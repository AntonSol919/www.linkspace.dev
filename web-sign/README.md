Web-sign lets anyone share a link with a user that directs them to build, sign, and submit linkpoints based on URL parameters.
The user's identity is ONLY saved in the browser under this domain name web-sign domain. i.e. www.linkspace.dev

Anyone can ask the user for this identity - the identity stays the same across all services.
The examples folder has a script that creates a HTTP Post endpoint. Use this as a destination to try it out.
